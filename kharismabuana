WITH t1 AS(SELECT STUDENT_ID, NAME, AGE,
CASE
	WHEN (AGE) > 15 THEN 'High School'
	WHEN (AGE) < 16 THEN 'Middle School'
	END AS GROUP_AGE
FROM cd.student)

SELECT GROUP_AGE, COUNT(GROUP_AGE) AS NO_OF_STUDENT
FROM t1
GROUP BY GROUP_AGE

-- d. Answer
SELECT * FROM cd.student
WHERE AGE = (SELECT MAX(AGE) FROM cd.student)

-- ANOTHER QUERY

ORDER BY AGE DESC
LIMIT 1

-- e. Answer
SELECT *, (SELECT SUM(AGE) 
		   FROM cd.student ST2
		   WHERE ST2.STUDENT_ID<=ST1.STUDENT_ID) AS cumulative_age
FROM cd.student ST1
ORDER BY ST1.STUDENT_ID

-- f. Answer
According to the table it can be interpreted that the categories of students that is classified by age shows that there are 3 junior high school/middle school students and 1 high school student. Then there was 1 student who did not enter the class that are not mapped with classroom's table.  We can assume that students who did not join any classes might join the 123 classroom by looking at the age category that has been classified. We could also see the oldest student compared to other students, named Marqueez, which is 16 years old.

Question:
1. Find the youngest and oldest age of the group age, for each classroom.
2. For each classroom, how many students.
3. Find in percentage for each age from total student in table.
